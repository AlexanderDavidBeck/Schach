Checklist

1. Create the game board: You will need to create a 2D array to represent the game board and initialize it with the starting positions of all the pieces.

2. Implement piece movements: For each type of piece, you will need to implement the rules for how it can move. For example, a bishop can move diagonally in any direction, while a knight moves in an L-shape.

3. Check for valid moves: Before a piece can be moved, you will need to check if the move is valid according to the rules of the game. For example, a piece cannot move to a square that is already occupied by one of its own pieces.

4. Implement capturing pieces: When a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured and removed from the board.

5. Implement special moves: There are several special moves in chess, such as castling, en passant, and promotion. You will need to implement these rules so that they can be performed correctly.

6. Implement check, checkmate, and stalemate: When a king is threatened with capture, it is in check. If the king cannot escape check by moving to another square or capturing the threatening piece, the game is over and the king is checkmated. If neither player has a legal move, the game ends in a stalemate.
   
7. Implement a user interface: Finally, you will need to implement a user interface for players to interact with the game. This could be a console-based interface, a graphical user interface, or a combination of both.
